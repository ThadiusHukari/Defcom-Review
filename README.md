# Defcom-Review

I watched Metacortex and Grifter - Touring the Darkside of the Internet. It was very informative because of my limited knowledge about Darknet and Tor. I’ve always been curious about these subjects, but had never done much research. It was surprising how easy it was to access everything. I will definitely be rewatching this video and other videos like it, along with reading more about what’s out there and how to access it. It seems very necessary to have a designated computer for these activities. I don’t want my personal/work computer compromised in anyway. I would guess that simply searching most of these activities has to raise some red flags.

I understand the general concept of bitcoin. I wish they explained how you liquify your wallet without it being traced.
